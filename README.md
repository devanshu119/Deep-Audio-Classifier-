# Deep Audio Classifier

A deep learning-based audio classification project built with TensorFlow and Python. This project aims to classify audio samples into predefined categories by converting audio signals into spectrograms and training a neural network model.

## 🚀 Features

- Transforms audio files into spectrograms for visual representation.
- Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification tasks.
- Includes a Jupyter Notebook (`AudioClassification.ipynb`) demonstrating the entire workflow.
- Provides a `results.csv` file containing classification outcomes.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devanshu119/Deep-Audio-Classifier-.git
   cd Deep-Audio-Classifier-
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow==2.4.1 tensorflow-io matplotlib
   ```

   *Note:* Ensure you have Python 3.6–3.8 installed, as TensorFlow 2.4.1 is compatible with these versions.

## 📊 Usage

1. **Prepare your dataset:**

   - Organize your audio files into separate folders, each named after the class label.
   - Ensure all audio files are in a compatible format (e.g., `.wav`).

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook AudioClassification.ipynb
   ```

   - Follow the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.

3. **Review Results:**

   - After training, the model's predictions will be saved in `results.csv`.
   - Use this file to analyze classification outcomes and model accuracy.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The model employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which is effective for processing spectrogram images derived from audio signals. This approach leverages spatial hierarchies in data, making it suitable for audio classification tasks.

## 📈 Results

The `results.csv` file contains the classification results, including predicted labels and corresponding confidence scores. This allows for detailed analysis and validation of the model's performance.
